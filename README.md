### Current Project
Iâ€™m currently working on the computational physics module at my university. This module so far has involved writing algorithms using linear algebra, partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations, to solve physics problems. Algorithms I have collaborated on with my group:  
- Runge-Kutta Methods (RK2, RK4, RKF45)
- Successive Over Relaxation 
- Gauss-Seidel
- Jacobi Iteration Solver  
- Finite Difference Method

### Interests 
- Physics  
- Machine Learning
