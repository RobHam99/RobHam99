### Current Project
Iâ€™m currently working on the computational physics module at my university. This module so far has involved writing algorithms using linear algebra and partial differential equations to solve physics problems. Algorithms I have collaborated on with my group:  
- Successive Over Relaxation 
- Gauss-Seidel
- Jacobi Iteration Solver  
- Finite Difference Method
